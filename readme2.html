<h2 id="step1-user-investigationpact-analysis">Step1: User Investigation/PACT ANALYSIS</h2>
<p>To conduct the PACT (People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies) analysis, a Google Form as (<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLScA91j1xsRzqu1iCsfSLHOXerUZcJicqLlEjfBDLPCdfW7DTg/formResponse">https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLScA91j1xsRzqu1iCsfSLHOXerUZcJicqLlEjfBDLPCdfW7DTg/formResponse</a>) was created and distributed among the target user group, which consists of students. The form contained questions about the respondents' social media usage habits, preferences, and desired features. The responses were collected and analyzed to identify patterns and trends, which were then used to create the following report.</p>
<p>Apart from the google survey, we investigate past paper and research to understand the user's needs and preferences.
We also create a persona to represent the target user group and provide a detailed analysis of the findings.</p>

<h3 id="past-paper-and-research">Past Paper and Research</h3>
<p>Social media users are predominantly young people with basic technology skills, commonly using devices such as smartphones and laptops (King, 2021). For this demographic, design is highly important; they place significant value on the app's aesthetics, compatibility across devices, and robust security features. Ensuring that the social media platform is visually appealing, user-friendly, and secure can greatly enhance their experience and satisfaction (Moshagen &amp; Thielsch, 2010).</p>

<h2 id="step-2-navigation-design">Step 2: Navigation design</h2>
<h3 id="card-sorting">Card Sorting</h3>
<p><img src="file:////Users/linjack/INFO2222/report_image/card1.png" alt="Card1">
To better understand the preferences and needs of our users for the web chat application, we conducted a card sorting activity with a group from the INFO2222 community. In this activity, we provided participants with basic elements, including various functionalities and interface components such as login, sign-up, navigation, viewing chatrooms, sending messages, dark mode, and more. The participants were encouraged to create their own tags and add new elements to categorize these items, allowing for a more flexible and user-driven organization.</p>
<p>The result is as follows:
<img src="file:////Users/linjack/INFO2222/report_image/card2.png" alt="Card2"></p>
<h3 id="site-map-design">Site Map design</h3>
<p>The card sorting activity revealed that the participants divide functionalities into five main group as:</p>
<h4 id="startpoint">StartPoint</h4>
<p>Elements: Login, Sign-up, Navigation, Guides, Dark Mode</p>
<p>Analysis: Participants identified basic entry points and general navigation elements as part of the initial interaction with the application. This highlights the importance of having a user-friendly and accessible starting interface.</p>
<h4 id="homepage">HomePage</h4>
<p>Elements: Start Chat, Add/Delete Friend, Viewing Friend List, Log out, Dark Mode</p>
<p>Analysis: The homepage is seen as a central hub where users can quickly access primary functionalities like starting a chat, managing friends, and viewing the friend list. The inclusion of “Dark Mode” in multiple categories suggests its high importance across different sections.</p>
<h4 id="post-page">Post Page</h4>
<p>Elements: Public Post, Filter, Retrieve/Modify Post, Report, Anonymous Chat/Post, Log out, Dark Mode</p>
<p>Analysis: The post page is recognized for its focus on content management and user interactions. Features such as public posting, filtering, and modifying posts are crucial for this section, indicating that users value flexibility and control over their content.</p>
<h4 id="security-page">Security Page</h4>
<p>Elements: Reset Password, Verifying and Security, Dark Mode, Log out</p>
<p>Analysis: Security is a significant concern for users, with emphasis on functionalities related to password management and security verification.</p>
<h4 id="chatroom">Chatroom</h4>
<p>Elements: Viewing Chatroom, Send Message, Dark Mode, Log out</p>
<p>Analysis: The chatroom is a dedicated space for real-time communication, with a focus on viewing and sending messages. Consistency in including “Dark Mode” and “Log out” indicates that these features are seen as essential across the application.</p>
<p>Based on these investigations, we develop a basic structure as the site map here.
<img src="file:////Users/linjack/INFO2222/report_image/sitemap.png" alt="SiteMap"><br>
The web-app will involve a multi-layered architecture designed to provide a seamless and secure user experience, structured according to the site map. At the top level, the Login/Signup page serves as the entry point, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the application.</p>
<p>Home Page
Once authenticated, users land on the Home page, which acts as the central hub for navigation. From here, users can access various sections of the application:</p>
<p>Friends Pages
Start Chat Room: Allows users to initiate new chat rooms.
Handle Friend Request: Manages incoming and outgoing friend requests.
View Friends: Displays a list of friends.
Chat Room: Contains sub-pages for viewing chat rooms and sending messages.
Public Posts
View Single Post: Enables users to view individual posts.
Publish Post: Allows users to create and publish new posts.
Anonymous Mode: Offers an option to post anonymously.
Filter: Provides functionality to filter posts based on various criteria.
Security
Reset Password: Allows users to reset their passwords, enhancing account security.
For All Pages
Guide: Provides user guides and documentation.
Log Out: Enables users to securely log out of the application.
Dark Mode: Offers a toggle option for dark mode, enhancing the user interface experience.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-design-evaluate">Step 3: Design-Evaluate</h3>
<h4 id="feature-prioritization">Feature Prioritization</h4>
<p>Based on the feedback , we have compiled the following prioritized list of features. These features are intended to improve the overall user experience and usability of the ChatConnect application:</p>
<p>Dark Mode
Anonymous Posting
Modify and Retrieve Posts</p>
<p>While not all features may be developed within the scope of this project, this list serves as a 'wish list' for future enhancements.</p>
<h4 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h4>
<p>Steps to Determine the Best Design</p>
<p>Brainstorming and Sketching: Our team began by brainstorming potential layouts and features. We sketched various designs for key interfaces such as the chat window and post page.
Prototype Creation: Based on our sketches, we created low-fidelity digital prototypes using Figma. These prototypes focused on layout and functionality without detailed design elements.
Guerrilla Testing: We conducted guerrilla testing with target users, including both team members and one participant outside our team. Each team member facilitated a test session to gather diverse feedback.
Feedback Analysis: We analyzed the feedback to identify common usability issues and preferences.</p>
<h4 id="wireframe">Wireframe</h4>
<p><img src="file:////Users/linjack/INFO2222/report_image/wireframe.png" alt="wireframe">
We created a wireframe to visualize the layout and structure of the ChatConnect application. The wireframe includes key elements such as the chat window, post page, and navigation bar. This visual representation helps us understand the overall flow and interaction within the application.</p>
<h4 id="guerrilla-testing">Guerrilla Testing</h4>
<p>We conducted guerrilla testing with target users to gather feedback on the wireframe prototype. The testing sessions involved offering the wireframe and site map to participants and asking them to answer questions on how to navigate the application (<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fqeB0CirUTQG9yBnO1nHQJAleF59D7RVtiFB5RT3rBc/viewanalytics">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fqeB0CirUTQG9yBnO1nHQJAleF59D7RVtiFB5RT3rBc/viewanalytics</a>), locate specific features, and provide general feedback on the design.</p>
<p>The result for the testing is as follows:
<img src="file:////Users/linjack/INFO2222/report_image/test1.png" alt="test1">
<img src="file:////Users/linjack/INFO2222/report_image/test2.png" alt="test2">
<img src="file:////Users/linjack/INFO2222/report_image/test3.png" alt="test3"></p>
<p>The result of the testing indicates that the wireframe design is generally well-received by users. Participants found the layout intuitive and easy to navigate, with positive feedback on the visual hierarchy and organization of elements. However, some users suggested minor improvements, such as the homepage is too crowded.</p>
